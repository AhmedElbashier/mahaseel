Mahaseel Web Workspace

Structure prepared for two web apps and shared packages.

Folders
- apps/admin: Admin dashboard web app
- apps/user: End-user web app (future)
- packages/shared: Shared UI, hooks, utils, styles

Notes
- Technology stack (e.g., Next.js, Vite + React, Angular) to be decided.
- This structure supports a monorepo approach, but no tooling is enforced yet.
